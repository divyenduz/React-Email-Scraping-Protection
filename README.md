# React Scraping Protection

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/divyenduz/React-Scraping-Protection.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

- Lazy load a string to avoid it being scraped by them bots. 

# Why

- This component hopes to be able to protect content (email etc) from bots when React components are rendered on the server side. 

- Note that this component has not yet been tested at all in a server side rendering environment (local or prod). The API may change a ton as I come to it.
